# personal_linkedin_activity
A project where I share opinions on some of the activity I see on LinkedIn. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I've finally had it with keeping my opinions to myself in these troubling times. Not many jobs left in some American economic sectors. US Military 
advertising huge sign-on bonuses to serve the country. Crappy service jobs getting cut. Not to be lazy, but the US military is kinda for chumps. I 
wouldn't have had a problem joining half a decade ago. And these crappy service jobs... do I look like a Latin American woman immigrating over here 
to start from the bottom and work my way up the top like a gold digger? Or am I a p***** a** mother f*****? 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

There is this disturbing pattern going on in some areas of the American economy. Weaknesses from the over-reliance of American techno-economics on 
software have really started to spill out into the open. 

First of all, it's like all the kings died, and made everyone else kings, especially the idiots and greedy since those two are going to be a part of any 
discussion. Not saying that autocracy should be the thing, but give me a F***ing break.

Secondly, how much of the American economy has come to be built off of vaporware? Maybe I didn't see it before. But ever since Covid-19 and the lockdowns 
that followed, the financial numbers that get put out and what is there, what can be bought, just does not add up. I get that many areas of the developed 
world have been put into a kind of Cold War pseudo-tense situation. But come on now. Is everyone just going to keep on lying and boasting? Is this still 
high school, showing off and all? Keeping dirty secrets? Sucking cock in the football locker room? 

Look. I'm trying to be real here. Truly. I don't mean offense but I also don't mean no offense either, see what I'm saying? I'm just saying it like how it 
is, how I see it. 

I am not demanding respect, necessarily. Since many people have made it their mission to play around with unscrupulous tactics and make fallacious or 
questionable statements, I am doing the same now. 

So here we begin, screenshots of the eye-catching posts I've seen on LinkedIn, as well as my commentary.
